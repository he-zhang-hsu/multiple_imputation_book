Example11.1.R and Example11.2.R are simulation programs.

Example11.6.R is a simulation program and calls the WinBUGS file logitmodel_mismeasure_bivariate_forR.txt.

Example11.11 is a simulation and uses two programs. Example11.11.R simulates the data and example11.11.SAS analyzes the simulated data.
