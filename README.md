To store code and datasets for Chapter 6: Multiple Imputation for Multivariate Missing Data: the Fully Conditional Specification Approach

Example7.3.R is a simulation program. It calls the WinBUGS program normal_fcs_cut.txt.

Example7.7.R is a simulation program. It calls the WinBUGS program logitmodel_missing_bivariate_forR.txt, which can be found in Chapter 6.

Example7.8.R is a simulation program. It calls the WinBUGS program logitmodel_missinginteraction_JMforR.txt, logitmodel_missinginteraction_fcsforR.txt, and logitmodel_missinginteraction_fcs_mix_forR.txt.

example7.9.sas required data sbirth.txt, which can be found in Chapter 6.
