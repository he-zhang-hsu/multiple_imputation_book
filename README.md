To store code and datasets for Chapter 3: Multiple Imtpuation Analysis: Basics

Example 3.2.R, 3.4.R, 3.8.R are simulation programs.


Example 1.10 uses three programs: example1.10.FAMILYXX.sas; example1.10.HOUSEHLD.sas; example1.10.main.sas. It also uses the datasets including familyxx.dat, househld.dat, incmimp1-incmimp5.dat. All these files are public-use file of NHIS 2016 including the family component, household component, and five sets of imputed income file. They can be downloaded via https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/nhis_2016_data_release.htm. For example 1.10, it is recommended running example1.10.FAMILYXX.sas and example1.10.HOUSEHLD.sas first before running example1.10.main.sas to set up the correct sas formats.
