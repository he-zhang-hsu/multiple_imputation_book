To store code and datasets for Chapter 5: Multiple Imputation for Univariate Missing Data: Robust Methods

Example5.1.R, Example5.3.R, Example5.4.R, Example5.6.R, Example5.7.R, and Example5.8.R are simulation programs.

Example5.5.R and Example5.10.R use the missing gestational age data, dgestat.txt, which can be found in Chapter 4. 

Example5.2.R uses the dataset income.dat, which can be found in Chapter 1.
